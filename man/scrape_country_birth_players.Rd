}
\arguments{
\item{country}{A character vector of country names (e.g., "Dominican Republic", "Venezuela").}
}

}
\description{
Scrapes the Baseball Reference website for a table of all MLB players born
in the specified country. The function returns the full table with cleaned
columns, converts birth dates and debut dates to `Date` class, splits the
birthplace into city and state (if available), and sorts the players by
debut date (ascending).
}
\details{
The function accesses pages like `https://www.baseball-reference.com/bio/<country>_born.shtml`.
It handles multiple countries and skips any unavailable pages gracefully.
